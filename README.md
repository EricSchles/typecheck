# Type checker

This program is intended to have similar functionality to the python type
method which tells you the type of an object or primitive.  

It is hugely valuable and I wonder why java hasn't implemented it's own.
Therefore I am creating my own naive method.

##How to run:

type([Some type]) -> returns a string with the type in format: <type [type of object]>
